plone.app.event.ploneintegration Installation
---------------------------------------------

To install plone.app.event.ploneintegration into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* When you're reading this you have probably already run 
  ``easy_install plone.app.event.ploneintegration``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``plone.app.event.ploneintegration`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        plone.app.event.ploneintegration
       
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
