uu.eventintegration
===================

A Plone 4.2 + Dexterity based integation of plone.app.event, originally based
on plone.app.event-ploneintegration 1.1

This fork of plone.app.event-ploneintegration is for UPIQ.org and uses
Dexterity types instead of Archetypes content types.

This package also contains a calendar type, and installing this package
hides from the add menu events in places other than this calendar folder
type.  Stock Event type is also hidden.

This package integrates plone.app.event into Plone 4 releases, where
plone.app.event is not in the core. This is the case for all Plone 4 releases
at the time of this release.
